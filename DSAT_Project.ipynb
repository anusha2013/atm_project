    "Introduction\n",
    "In earlier years, all the transactions were to be done manually. As it is a difficult task, so now banks use ‘Atm’ to give their customers have easy and faster transactions. Thus this project is a good task to have transactions easier, faster and for emergencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope\n",
    "• It can be implemented in atm machine by owner of bank or in charge of branch.\n",
    "• It is easy to learn the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "Our main objective is to speed up the transactions done by the customers. The user can deposit, withdraw or check balance of their account without having to visit the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Development\n",
    "The project has been made in jupyter notebook using classes and methods.\n",
    "User has to enter the pin. If the pin gets verified, he can perform transactions in his account.\n",
    "He has to choose the options as to what he wants to do. He can deposit, withdraw, check balance or transfer the funds.\n",
